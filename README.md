# Overview
-  MongoDB is used as store base. The quickest way to run it if MongoDB hasn't been installes it is to run it in 
docker container using the following command:
```
  docker run --rm -d \
   --name mongo-server \
   -p 27017:27017 \
    mongo
```
- To populate MongoDB is using `migrate-mongo` framework and set of scripts which may be found here `/migrations/`. 
```
  npm install migrate-mongo -g
```
Since `migrate-mongo` doesn't support Typescript before running any command the code should be transpiled. For example, 
to run all unapplied database migrations is necessarry to run the following command:
```
  tsc && migrate-mongo up
```
